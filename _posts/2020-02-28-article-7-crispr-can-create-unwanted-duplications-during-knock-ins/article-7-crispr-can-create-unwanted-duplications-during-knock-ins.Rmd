| General topic?               | Undetectable mutations using conventional methods questions the reliability of Crispr Cas 9.                      |
| What was examined?       | Researchers reveal through a study that Crispr Cas 9 brings problems that are difficult to detect with a simple PCR analysis. Indeed, when we edit genes inserted in mice, unwanted genes are modified and duplicated. The study carried out on mice with molecular biology techniques. The duplication of these mutations can't be detected with classic methods. There could be negative consequences in human gene therapy.      |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Crispr Cas 9 is a great tool, but laboratories has to keep the accuracy of their mesures and researchers have to be aware issues can occur.      |
| Remaining questions?         | Researchers don't have a perfect understanding of Crispr Cas9. Does improving the precision of the method reduce the risk of mutations?       |
