| General topic?               | A lot of campagnies (like Genomelink, GenePlaza, Sequencing.com or Helix) are selling reports with genomic data to consumers who wan’t to know more about their traits. This kind of direct-to-consumers (DTS) tests are becoming very popular but some scientists explain that this companies provide informations less reliable that consumers think.                      |
| What was examined?       | Diana Kwon focuses on two aspects, namely the limits of GWAS and how we can educate consumers to interprate the information. On the one hand, we need to understand what GWAS means. GWAS is the acronym for « genome-wide association studies ». In DTS tests, this sudies informations are used to estimate how likely a person will develop a specific trait. The problem is that scientists can’t predict the phenotype only compairing DNA data because of the influence of social and environmental reasons. On the other hand, companies must be transparence with the method they use to describe a trait description     |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Receiving information of our traits is a fun activity if people read the disclaimers behind the test       |
| Remaining questions?         | How well do the consumers understand the limits of DNA data ?       |
